## fsds Python package

The source code of the [fsds Python package](src/fsds) was originally taken from the [Formula Student Driverless Simulator](https://github.com/FS-Driverless/Formula-Student-Driverless-Simulator) repository at commit [56d674c](https://github.com/FS-Driverless/Formula-Student-Driverless-Simulator/tree/56d674cd2757dff58e2f066ae6bbbc316c9bb71b). Additional changes were made to make it a Python package for Python 3.13.
